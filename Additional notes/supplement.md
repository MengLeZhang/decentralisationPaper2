##  Causal inference (or lack therefore)

Whilst we compare similar Scottish and English TTWA to establish like for like comparison, we lack the ability to establish the causal effect of devolution on segregation and inequality without recourse to some unproveable assumptions. First, one must assume that, prior to Devolution, trends were similar in England and Scotland for the measure in question (RCI or DI). Unfortunately, we cannot easily verify this due to data limitations, so our findings are not strictly causal. Secondly, a key assumption is that levels of segregation in Scottish TTWAs would have been the same as comparable English TTWAs if devolution had not taken place (after statistical adjustment). Ideally, we would find comparative TTWAs based on pre-devolution levels of segregation and inequality. Unfortunately, such areas are not available in a comparable format over time. However, we consider variables sourced from the 2004 IMDs as acceptable proxies for the same measures in 1999 since i) any effect of the devolution process on segregation is likely to be lagged; ii) most IMD variables in 2004 are based on data recorded at least a few years earlier and often based on the 2001 Census, and iii) we expect that segregation and the population in general within a TTWA will tend to change very slowly over time. Finally, the elimination of  cross-border TTWAs limits bias caused by potential contamination of the treatment (e.g. TTWAs that are both in England and Scotland). However, we accept that other key assumptions may be unrealistic and our estimates remain suggestive of how devolution may have affected segregation. For example, the Stable Unit Treatment Value assumption that devolution for Scotland did not affect English segregation directly (through spill-over effects possibly due to migration) or indirectly (through Scottish policies influencing English policies) (Holland 1986).
