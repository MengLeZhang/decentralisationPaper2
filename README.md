## Summary
This implement the decentralisation of poverty and spatial inequality index for 
England and Wales only for the all-parlimentary call on evidence regarding 
social mobility and social housing [https://www.communitiesthatwork.co.uk/appg/].

We are redoing the results using social housing instead of those in poverty. 
Results based on census estimates.
